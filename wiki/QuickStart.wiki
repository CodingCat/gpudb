==Data Generation==

===SSBM Data Generation===
The dbgen to generate original SSBM data is located

The original SSBM data cannot be directly used by our engine.
The data need to be transformed into column-stored data. 
Enter tools/ directory and execute Make, which will generate
"gpuDBLoad" to transform the data.
