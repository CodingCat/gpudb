#summary Supported Query Format.

Currently we only support queries that have similar formats as Star Schema Benchmark queries. We have included Star Schema Benchmark queries in the directory test/ssb_test .

When the query has join operations, we assume the first table to be the fact table, and the rest tables to be the dimension tables. For example,

  select A.col, B.col from A, B where A.key = B.key;
