#summary Supported Query Format.

Currently we only support queries that have similar formats as Star Schema Benchmark queries. We have included Star Schema Benchmark queries in the directory test/ssb_test .

When the query has join operations, we assume the first table to be the fact table, and the rest tables to be the dimension tables. For example,

  select ** from A, B where A.key = B.key;
