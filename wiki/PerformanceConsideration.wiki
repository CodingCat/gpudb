===Query Plan===
Query execution plan has a large impact on query performance. Currently our tool cannot automatically determine the optimal query execution plan for a given query. Although some optimization techniques like predicate push down have already been adopted to optimize the query plan, it doesn't change the execution sequence of the query operators in the query. For example, considering the following query (q2.1 from Star Schema Benchmark), after the selection operations, the generated query plan by our tool will join lineorder with supplier first, then join the result with part, and finally with ddate.

{{{
   select sum(lo_revenue),d_year,p_brand1
   from lineorder,supplier, part,ddate
   where lo_orderdate = d_datekey
         and lo_partkey = p_partkey
         and lo_suppkey = s_suppkey
         and p_category = 'MFGR#12'
         and s_region = 'AMERICA'
         group by d_year,p_brand1
         order by d_year,p_brand1; 
}}}


In this case, users should manually optimize the query
